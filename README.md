## Proposal

### Background and motivation

In many temperate and boreal ecosystems, the start of the growing season (Start of Season, SOS) has shifted earlier in recent decades due to warming. Earlier phenology can increase the risk that vegetation is exposed to freezing temperatures after leaf-out, often referred to as “false spring” or late-spring frost events. Such events can cause damage to emerging leaves and buds, potentially reducing photosynthesis and altering ecosystem carbon uptake. Despite growing attention to frost risk, there is still limited empirical evidence on (i) how the frequency of frost days after SOS has changed over time, and (ii) how strongly these events affect gross primary productivity (GPP) and net CO₂ exchange across ecosystem types.

### Objectives and research questions

This project aims to quantify the occurrence of frost after SOS and evaluate its short-term impact on carbon fluxes using eddy-covariance measurements.

**Key research questions:**

Frequency and trends: How often do frost days occur after SOS, and has this frequency changed in the most recent 25 years compared to the 25 years before?

Impact magnitude: How large is the immediate GPP reduction following frost events?

Ecosystem differences: Do responses differ systematically across plant functional types and ecosystem categories (e.g., deciduous vs. evergreen forests, grasslands)?

Timing sensitivity: Does the impact depend on how many days after SOS the frost event occurs?

### Data and study system

The analysis will use FluxDataKit (GECO Bern), which provides harmonized eddy-covariance flux data and site-level meteorological drivers such as air temperature:

These data enable identifying frost events directly from measured temperatures and quantifying carbon-flux responses at daily to weekly timescales.

### Methods (initial plan)

SOS definition: Derive SOS per site-year using a flux-based or temperature/phenology-proxy approach (to be selected based on data availability and robustness).

Frost event detection: Define frost days after SOS using a temperature threshold and identify events within a window after SOS.

Trend analysis: Compare frost-after-SOS frequency between two periods (e.g., 25-year blocks where available) and test for trends over time across sites and ecosystem types.

Flux response quantification: Use event-based composites (before/after comparisons) and regression/event-study approaches to estimate immediate GPP anomalies following frost events while controlling for radiation and other confounders.

Effect of timing: Relate response magnitude to “days since SOS” at the time of frost and compare across ecosystem categories.

### Expected outcomes

A multi-site assessment of whether post-SOS frost exposure has become more or less common over recent decades.

Quantitative estimates of GPP reductions following frost events, including how long effects persist.

Evidence for differences in vulnerability across ecosystem/plant functional types and sensitivity to event timing relative to SOS.

### Relevance

This work helps connect changing spring phenology to ecosystem carbon cycling, improving understanding of climate-driven risks to terrestrial carbon uptake. The analysis is directly grounded in observation-based flux and meteorological records and can contribute to improving how models represent “false spring” impacts on productivity.
